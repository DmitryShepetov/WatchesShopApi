Good afternoon, this is my first REST API project, it is older than dinosaurs, do not judge strictly

P.S Create a database using Migrations

GET api/watch/ - Getting all watches

PUT api/watch/ - Create new watches

DELETE api/watch/5 (id) - Delete watches


GET api/ShopCart/ - Getting ShopCart

POST api/ShopCart/ - Create ShopCart


POST api/Order/(The order itself) - Create Orders


GET api/Home/ - Getting watches for the home page

For all errors, write to the developer to fix
